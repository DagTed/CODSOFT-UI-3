Restaurant menu app UI


Description:
This project is part of the Codsoft UI/UX Internship and focuses on designing and implementing an intuitive, 
user-friendly Restaurant Menu App UI. The goal was to create a seamless experience for users to browse the menu, place orders,
and manage their preferences while ensuring simplicity, personalization, and ease of navigation.

My Role:
As the UI/UX Designer and Developer, I designed the user interface (UI) for the restaurant menu app. 
I addressed user experience (UX) challenges to enhance usability and ensure a smooth interaction flow.

Challenges:
Balancing simplicity with the need to provide comprehensive functionality, 
such as order tracking, table reservations, and payment options.

Design Strategy:

Prioritize essential features that enhance the ordering experience.

Use intuitive navigation to allow users to browse the menu, book tables, and place orders effortlessly.

Implement clear, concise labels, icons, and visual cues for menu categories, cart, and favorites.

Ensure a clean layout with minimal steps to complete actions, like adding items to the cart or making payments.

Enable personalization through favorites and seamless tracking of order history.

Features:

Book a Table: Users can reserve tables directly from the app with a simple booking form.

Add to Cart: A straightforward process to add menu items to the cart for easy checkout.

Add Favorites: Users can save their favorite dishes to quickly reorder or view them later.

Secure Payment Options: Multiple payment options (e.g., credit/debit card, digital wallets) for quick and secure transactions.

Login & Registration: Simple signup and login process with options for social login (Google, Facebook, Apple).

Track Order: Real-time tracking of orders from preparation to delivery.

Light and Dark Mode: Users can switch between light and dark themes for better accessibility and personalization.

Outcome:
Successfully designed and implemented the restaurant menu app UI with a focus on usability, functionality, and user satisfaction. The app provides a seamless experience for users to browse menus, place orders, and manage their dining preferences effortlessly.
